    <h1>CSS Can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h1>
    <br>
    <ul class="a1">
        <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
        <li>External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. however, <mark class="m1">in this tutitorial we will <br>use inline and internal styles,</mark> because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself</li>

    <p class="para1">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that <br> you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.</p>
    <p class="para2">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>
    <p class="para3">There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
